Analysis of United Nations General Assembly Debates

## 1 Introduction: 

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 after the end of World War II with the aim of promoting peace, security, and cooperation among nations. It is made up of 193 member states and has various specialized agencies, programs, and funds to carry out its mandate.
 
One of the key functions of the UN is to provide a forum for member states to debate and negotiate on a wide range of global issues such as climate change, human rights, disarmament, and development. These debates take place in various UN bodies such as the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council, among others.
 
Debates in the UN can be intense and complex, as member states have different perspectives, interests, and priorities. However, they provide a platform for member states to engage with one another, exchange ideas, and seek common solutions to shared challenges. The UN also promotes multilateralism, which means that decisions are made collectively by member states rather than unilaterally by individual countries.

## 2 Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze the UN General Debates of the past 49 years to identify the countries that have been most vocal about issues related to climate change, energy, and sustainable development. This analysis will be conducted through sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic analysis to provide insights into the positions and stances of different countries. 

The results of this analysis will assist organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), in developing targeted funding and support programs for countries that are actively advocating for sustainable development initiatives.

## 3 Dataset

The UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) is a dataset that includes English language transcripts of General Debate statements delivered at the United Nations General Assembly from 1970 (Session 25) to 2018 (Session 73). The dataset includes a total of 8,093 texts, with an average length of approximately 17,600 characters per speech. The UNGDC provides a unique and valuable source of information on the policy positions and perspectives of UN member states on a wide range of global issues, such as peace and security, human rights, development, and climate change. The dataset includes data on 200 countries, which makes it a comprehensive resource for analyzing the diversity of perspectives and policy priorities from around the world.
